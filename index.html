        <h2> Flatland </h2>
        <h3>
        <p> This was our 3rd webpage development project, where we would create a to do list. This webpage required HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to operate. The function was simple, 
            it would allow the users to add into the text box where they would write a list of things to do. And would be able to check it off as they completed them.
        </p>
        </h3>
        <h4>
        <p>
          This webpage allowed us to learn the language of HTML, CSS and Javascript, Hypertext Markup Language is where we would use HTML to input the text we want and adding links from there. Essentially HTML is used to define the content and structure of our webpage
        </p>
        </h4>
        <h5>
        <p>
          While CSS, Cascading Style Sheet is a form of language used to edit the presentation, format, styling and effect to give it more character and not like a boring plain page.
        </p>
        </h5>
        <h6>
        <p> And finally Javascript, or also known as JS for short. This language would allow users to interact with the webpage for example within this webpage Flat land, javascript allowed us to create interaction between users and the webpage,
          if you click on the red box a series of words on a list would appear, like a buzzword generator.
        </p>
